### I now host my personal projects on GitLab
https://gitlab.com/orowith2os

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

You can call me Oro, but I may also be known as OroWith2Os or OroWwith2Os

My pronouns are `she/they`

I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and have been peeking at D and Python.

I like to contribute more on the documentation and packaging side of things, rather than coding.

You can find me at the following links (socials):
