# UNAVAILABLE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

I will review any MRs and the like when I am available, most likely around mid-October

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

You can call me Oro, but I may also be known as OroWith2Os or OroWwith2Os

My pronouns are `they/them` and `she/her`

I am currently learning [Rust!](https://www.rust-lang.org)

PFP: https://www.pixiv.net/i/101595772

I like to contribute more on the documentation and packaging side of things, rather than coding.
